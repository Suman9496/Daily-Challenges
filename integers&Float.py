'''Data Types Practice
What type is the result of the sum of 7.5 + 2.5? Write the code to verify it.

To do this, create two variables:

num1 = 7.5

num2 = 2.5

Next, print on the screen the data type that results from the sum of both numbers.

Perform the same exercise in PyCharm to see the result. Can you explain what happens?
'''
num1 = 7.5
num2 = 2.5
num = (num1 + num2)
print(type(num))
